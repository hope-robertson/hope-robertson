      <h2>IQ and EQ</h2>
      <p>
        IQ is a number representing the results of a test for scoring academic abilities, the main ones being logic and abstract reasoning. <br>
        It was once falsely believed to be innate and fixed, but this has since been disproven, as EQ and IQ can build off one another and exist in tandem, and have nothing to do with a person's race or any other factor that proponents of eugenics clung to.<br>
        Environmental conditions and being provided the right information can help to improve IQ. <br><br>
EQ is one's ability to recognise and understand emotions in yourself and others, and the ability to use this awareness to manage your behaviour and relationships. <br>
In comparison to IQ, EQ is furthered through self-reflection, a more nebulous type of information coming from within oneself. <br>
The main way EQ is different to IQ is that it cannot be improved in a social vacuum, as there is nothing to reflect on if there are no new social experiences. <br> <br>
 Doing challenging and stressful things can promote growth, much like the pressure of the wind against a tree stimulating it to become stronger, but I believe this must be done with some caution and awareness of triggers, and activities you can do to self-regulate back to a place of mental and emotional equilibrium. <br> 
 To further the tree analogy, some trees have been damaged by extreme weather and must be provided some support to withstand the winds that are to come. <br> <br>
<h2>Why EQ Is Important To Me</h2>
The main reason why EQ is important to me is because I need to improve my abilities in recognising the signs of my own stress and managing it using techniques such as journaling, excercise and spending time in nature so that my general health is better. <br>When these things are well managed, I can be more receptive to new ideas, better at understanding concepts and more patient when working with other people. <br> <br>
 Studies have shown there is a strong connection between the mind and the gut, so taking care of mental health is related to taking care of physical health and vice versa. <br>
 Events in my life have caused me to have some skills when it comes to gathering context and picking up on the moods of others, so at this stage striking up a balance between worrying about the needs of others and my own needs is crucial for further self-development.
