      <h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>
      <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
        I currently have less of an idea about my long term goal and/or career
        pathway than I did when I wrote my Foundations learning plan. I have
        already been surprised by the things I am good and bad at, and that some
        qualities about me that I had considered unique are maybe more universal
        than I thought. My main long term goal now is to keep learning and going
        down coding-related rabbit holes on topics that interest me in my spare
        time. Ideally I would like a job that respects the amount of hard work I
        am capable of doing in a relatively short space of time, and which
        allows me to have enough time and freedom to do the things I need to do
        in order to stay level-headed.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I still think my biggest strength will be my creativity, but I know this
        might change and other strengths may come out once I am working within a
        larger group. I will have to back my creativity up with relevant
        information in order for it to be useful. My biggest limitation with
        technical things will most likely be my math skills, I will need to use
        my own time to refresh myself as it has been about 20 years since I
        tried hard at this.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
        be?
      </h2>
      <p>
        My biggest non-technical challenge will probably be over-commiting to
        things outside of study, and I will have to be firm with my bandmates
        about how much time I need for studying successfully, even if they don't
        quite understand it. The limitations with things like my skills in
        mathematics and logic can be overcome with some willpower and good time
        management, and don't have to be tied to anyone's emotions or
        expectations.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p>
        One human skill I would like to see improved is my communication,
        especially when I am focusing hard on a task or am going through some
        personal stuff. It can be very jarring when i am pulled out of those
        states, and I would like to know how to navigate that in a more
        professional way. I would also like to develop my skills in finding
        common ground when it somes to people's different approaches to doing
        things. I'm not too worried about thinking my way of doing things is the
        best, if anything I am apprehensive about sharing for fear of having my
        methods criticised. I know I can be receptive to feedback in other
        situations, so I do have faith that I will get there with programming.
      </p>
      <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
      <p>
        My expectations from the Bootcamp team are that they will provide me
        with plenty of resources to understand the concepts i need to implement
        in my coding, and that they will recognise I can't always comprehend how
        to solve a problem by reading a text-based message (especially when
        stressed) and may requre a back-and-forth brief chat on a Discord call.
      </p>
      <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h2>
      <p>
        The expectations I have of myself are that I will take care of my mental
        health, not over-commit to things for the sake of keeping the peace, and
        get enough sleep between the hours of 11pm and 8am (this will require
        being the no-fun flatmate!) so I can work during the hours in which my
        classmates and tutors will be available. I will communicate clearly
        which days/hours I am available as I can already see some patterns
        emerging which I will need to stick to in order to stay calm, creative
        and capable.
      </p>
      <h1>Foundations Learning Plan</h1>
      <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
        I would like to build accessible websites for people who may struggle
        with navigating the internet, such as those with disabilities or the
        elderly. I would also like to further my knowledge in the area of
        databases, as i previously worked for a television media company
        maintaining archives and liasing with the IT department to have good
        storage systems. I found this work satisfying, and know that a well
        thought-out system can save a lot of time and frustration further down
        the line.
      </p>

      <h2>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h2>
      <p>
        My strengths lie in creative thought, problem solving and effective but
        respectful communication with others. My limitations are my focus,
        getting started on projects and allowing my mood/emotions to cloud my
        mind when i need to use it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p>Focus, discipline, organisation and respect for others' abilities.</p>
      <h2>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I will stick to a schedule, and make sure I have composed myself before
        interacting with others.<br />

        I will keep my creative projects outside of the course going
        consistently so I am releasing emotions in a healthy way and reminding
        myself that I have managed to master other things over the years through
        perserverance.
        <br />
        If something gets to me during my study hours and I don't have time to
        work on my projects I will go for a brief walk to the river near my
        house.
        <br />I will first try to search for a solution online, and if the
        sources are unclear, the information is too vague or it has been longer
        than ten minutes I will post in discord for help.
        <br />
      </p>
      <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
      <p>
        I expect the Facilitation team to be understanding of the fact that
        sometimes I am confused by very easy concepts and that positive
        encouraging words have a big effect on me.
        <br />
      </p>
      <h2>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I have to practice music as i have recording and performance
        commitments, usually I will do this between 4 and 6 in the afternoons
        and may have to be out of town for the occasional weekend.
