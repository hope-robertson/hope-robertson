      <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
        I would like to build accessible websites for people who may struggle
        with navigating the internet, such as those with disabilities or the
        elderly. I would also like to further my knowledge in the area of
        databases, as i previously worked for a television media company
        maintaining archives and liasing with the IT department to have good
        storage systems. I found this work satisfying, and know that a well
        thought-out system can save a lot of time and frustration further down
        the line.
        <br />
      </p>

      <h2>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h2>
      <p>
        My strengths lie in creative thought, problem solving and effective but
        respectful communication with others. My limitations are my focus,
        getting started on projects and allowing my mood/emotions to cloud my
        mind when i need to use it.
        <br />
      </p>
      <h2>
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p>Focus, discipline, organisation and respect for others' abilities.</p>
      <h2>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I will stick to a schedule, and make sure I have composed myself before
        interacting with others.<br />

        I will keep my creative projects outside of the course going
        consistently so I am releasing emotions in a healthy way and reminding
        myself that I have managed to master other things over the years through
        perserverance.
        <br />
        If something gets to me during my study hours and I don't have time to
        work on my projects I will go for a brief walk to the river near my
        house.
        <br />I will first try to search for a solution online, and if the
        sources are unclear, the information is too vague or it has been longer
        than ten minutes I will post in discord for help.
        <br />
      </p>
      <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
      <p>
        I expect the Facilitation team to be understanding of the fact that
        sometimes I am confused by very easy concepts and that positive
        encouraging words have a big effect on me.
        <br />
      </p>
      <h2>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I have to practice music as i have recording and performance
        commitments, usually I will do this between 4 and 6 in the afternoons
        and may have to be out of town for the occasional weekend.
