      <h2>Foundations Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        Three things i have learned about myself and my ego are that I am
        generally pretty open about having a hard time but if something personal
        is going on I will put on a brave face so I don't have to be open until
        I have more of a game plan about how to be ok. I can see now that this
        is somewhat hypocritical as not being open with people is partly what
        has caused me some anguish recently. It surprised me that something like
        an ego could still exist in that form when I have felt like it was
        destroyed by life events humbling me. I have had to throw myself into
        doing things that I am somewhat good at (like music) to rebuild it back
        to a place where I have high enough self-esteem to be motivated to try
        the things I'm not as good at (yet).
        <br />
        <br />
        I have been thinking pretty deeply about my values lately as I am
        establishing boundaries to prevent being misunderstood by people further
        down the track, and so I have a quiet place to study undisturbed. Having
        a quiet place to think is essential for reflecting on what is stressing
        me out and what the things are that I can and can't do to improve my
        situation. You can think you have self-awareness but until you're
        regulated enough to untangle the things you physically feel in your body
        it's all just theoretical and too removed. Once this is sorted out you
        can trust your gut not only with personal things but also in learning
        and programming.
        <br /><br />
        I am doing better at recognising when i'm still confused about a topic
        and take a bit of time to learn more until that feeling of confusion has
        gone away. I am also doing better at recognising when some code looks a
        bit off and being prepared for it to not work perfectly. This helps me
        troubleshoot as well, because I can leave myself a note in the
        pseudocode when I have the feeling something could be written more
        simply or using a different method, and come back to it if necessary.
        <br /><br />
        What surprised me most about the core learning was how much I still love
        writing like I did in high school, but I have had to separate my more
        personal thoughts out into a more private journal so when I come to
        doing the core writing I've got those thoughts out of my system. If I
        spend a bit of time untangling the thoughts and feelings swirling around
        I can recognise which elements of my stress are being caused by what and
        identify the things that are applicable to core blog writing.
        <br /><br />
        The most challenging aspects of the core learning were definitely
        wishing I had a more neurotypical brain when doing the Emotional
        Intelligence and Growth Mindset parts.
        <br /><br />
        I think the focus on core learning in a web development bootcamp course
        is because being in a calm, regulated state is essential for maintaining
        your focus on writing code and accessing the creative part of your
        brain, which personally I find is easily affected by whatever is going
        on emotional. If you have some strategies for getting your brain out of
        the state of trying to logic its way out of your life problems, you can
        use it to write code.
        <br /><br />
        The time I spent learning core doesn't feel like a waste of time because
        I never would have been able to learn things and do programming without
        putting into place those strategies for self-regulation like journaling
        and exercise. I'm still not too sure about the concept of a Growth
        Mindset, but I put this down to the world being an uncertain place and
        the stereotype of online fitness influencers promoting stepping over
        anyone to get to where you want. I know that isn't how it works, and I
        will get there eventually but right now I am focusing on more simple
        strategies and being at peace with uncertainty.
