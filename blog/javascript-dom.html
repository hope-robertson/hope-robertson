        The Relationship Between HTML, CSS and Javascript
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraphtech3">
        An analogy I came up with last sprint was HTML being like a band
        entering a recording studio, with their song structures already decided,
        and CSS being the person producing their recordings, coming up with
        ideas about how to embellish things and (maybe) rearrange them. Building
        on that, I would say Javascript is like the modern-day recording
        software being used, which contains libraries and tools to
        enhance/change sounds and methods to pull all of the elements together
        to provide a finished product.
      </p>
      <h2 class="techblogquestion">
        An Example Process of Control Flow and Loops
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraphtech3">
        you take a shower in the morning, changing your state to clean. During
        the time in which you are not stinky, you go out into the world. the
        following is the order in which you would do everything: <br />
        <br />
        --become washed [ <br />
        ---prepare food <br />
        ---go to the supermarket <br />
        ---work out <br />
        ---clean the bathroom ] <br />
        while you were in your clean state, you did 4 different activities in a
        particular order, from least to most yuck, in the interests of health
        and safety. While in the first stage, preparing food, you encountered a
        loop because you had run out of cheese. <br />
        the loop would be -- if cheese does not exist > then go get more cheese
        > else starve --
      </p>
      <h2 class="techblogquestion">The DOM</h2>
      <p class="paragraphtech3">
        DOM is an acronym for Document Object Model.
        <br />
        It is a representation, in objects, of the entire HTML document. It is
        much like a family tree, but instead of family members, we are referring
        to 'nodes'. <br />
        Here is a chart showing an example of the DOM. <br />
      </p>
      <p class="centertech3">
        <img
          src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53585872137_3dc6743197_o.jpg"
          alt="chart showing flow of the DOM"
          class="centertech3"
        />
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="paragraphtech3">
        An example of interacting with the DOM would be when we access HTML
        elements using their tag name, class name or id with the querySelector
        or querySelectorAll method. <br />
        Below is an example of code showing how to select the first element with
        the class 'cheese-fridge': <br />

        let cheeseFridge = document.querySelector(".cheese-fridge") <br />
        <br />
        Here is an example of how to access 'child' elements within the selected
        element: <br />
        <br />
        let cheeseType = cheeseFridge.querySelector(".cheese-type"); <br />
        cheeseType.textContent = "Current Cheese Type"; <br />
      </p>
      <h2 class="techblogquestion">Accessing Data From Objects vs Arrays</h2>
      <p class="paragraphtech3">
        An object is defined as a collection of key-value pairs, which are data
        structures used to represent a piece of information. The key is an
        identifier for the data, which tells you what it represents. The value
        is the data associated with the key.<br /><br />

        Objects are best used when your data represents one thing with named
        properties and when you will be manipulating individual properties of
        the data rather than performing manipulations over the data as a whole
        entity, which would be best suited to an array. <br />
        <br />
        Another way to tell if it is appropriate to use an array is if the order
        of the data matters or if it is a group of things of the same type.
        <br />
        <br />
        The way that the data needs to be accessed (numerical index vs unique
        keys) is informed by considering the aforementioned situations, knowing
        that objects are unordered and arrays are ordered.
      </p>
      <h2 class="techblogquestion">Functions and Why They Are Useful</h2>
      <p class="paragraphtech3">
        A function is a reusable block of code created to perform a particular
        task, such as returning a string as shown in the code example below:
        <br />
        <br />

        // function greet() { <br />
        return 'Hey there!' }<br />
        let salutation = greet() //
        <br />
        <br />

        Functions are helpful as they let you break down complex tasks into more
        manageable steps, because they are like smaller programs within your
        main program. A function can be 'called', which means giving the
        function an instruction to run its defined set of instructions. In our
        example above, the last line of code is calling the function.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once a function has been defined it can be called multiple times with
        different inputs inserted if needed. It is easier to debug and test code
        when functions are used, as each one undertakes a specific task.
