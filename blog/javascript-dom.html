      The Relationship Between HTML, CSS and Javascript
    </h1>
    <p class="paragraphtech3">
      An analogy I came up with last sprint was HTML being like a band entering
      a recording studio, with their song structures already decided, and CSS
      being the person producing their recordings, coming up with ideas about
      how to embellish things and (maybe) rearrange them. Building on that, I
      would say Javascript is like the modern-day recording software being used,
      which contains libraries and tools to enhance/change sounds and methods to
      pull all of the elements together to provide a finished product.

      An Example Process of Control Flow and Loops
    </h1>
    <p>
      you take a shower in the morning, changing your state to clean. During the
      time in which you are not stinky, you go out into the world: <br />
      become washed <br />
      prepare food <br />
      go to the supermarket <br />
      work out <br />
      clean the bathroom <br />
      while you were in your clean state, you did 3 different activities in a
      particular order, from least to most yuck, in the interests of health and
      safety. While in the first stage, preparing food, you encountered a loop
      because you had run out of cheese. <br />
      the loop would be -- if cheese does not exist, then go get more cheese,
      else starve --
