      The Relationship Between HTML, CSS and Javascript
    </h2>
    <p>
      An analogy I came up with last sprint was HTML being like a band entering
      a recording studio, with their song structures already decided, and CSS
      being the person producing their recordings, coming up with ideas about
      how to embellish things and (maybe) rearrange them. Building on that, I
      would say Javascript is like the modern-day recording software being used,
      which contains libraries and tools to enhance/change sounds and methods to
      pull all of the elements together to provide a finished product.
