    <h2>
      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Recently I made an ethical decision to reduce my own physical discomfort
      and general health conditions (I have type 1 diabetes) by leaving my job
      in hospitality. I felt the need to be loyal to the business for a long
      time, as they had supported me financially and through personal things
      over the years, which has been hard but ultimately I know I am capable of
      achieving a lot more than I was and it is better to spend time with fewer
      friends if they are aligned with my values.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
      values and identity.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I have found since moving to Otautahi that the culture i grew up with in
      Dunedin was one where people speak their mind if there is an issue, which
      is not so much the case here. I have a tendency to be blunt at times as
      this is what my family are like, but here I am learning the benefits of
      taking a step back and thinking before speaking. I have also grown up in a
      culture of a lot of creativity, and solitude from being from somewhere a
      little bit out of town. Nature and the sea are very important to me, and I
      am energised by these things.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning
      journey.
    </h2>
    <p>
      My main strength is my creativity, this will support me by helping me
      think outside the box with problem solving, and as a source of stress
      relief and reflection when i am playing music outside of course time.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </h2>
    <p>
      With the ability to problem solve comes a lot of fatigue and even low mood
      after mental exertion. I am already finding i need to factor this in and
      rest after completing tasks, so looking ahead and forming a plan for the
      week/day is a good idea. I am not the best with simply reading through
      information and having it take up lodging in my memory, so this will
      affect my learning journey by making things take a bit longer.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
      but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the
      time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
      strategies you would try now and why.
    </h2>
    <p>
      An example of this would be when i have tried to get everyone in my bar
      job to work in the positions they were best at on a busy night, which was
      met with some opposition by the bar owner as they wanted to train the
      newer employee on making cocktails, which was normally my station. I had
      to step back and remember that it was her business, training people is
      part of the long term plan, and that we all started from nothing with our
      skills. The main strategy I would try differently now would be reassuring
      myself that this was not intended as a slight against my skills.
