      What are the best practices associated with using classes vs ids?
    </h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Classes and ids are used to define or change the layout, appearance and
      design of specific elements coded in HTML. A class is best used to define
      style where it may be applied to multiple elements on the page. An ID is
      appropriate where unique styling is needed for an element, meaning more
      than one element with the same ID cannot be used in an HTML document.
      Elements can be accessed through their ID using JavaScript. Here is an
      example of a piece of code that defines multiple elements as the same
      class and gives them the same styling. The styling is defined at the top
      of the code within the style block, and the classes are defined further
      down within the elements.

        alt="snippet of code showing class example"
      />

      You can have both class and id within the same element, here is an example
      where each list item has both an ID (element1 etc) and class (item):

      <img

        alt="example of code with both class and id"
      />

      Here is an example of id definition on its own in html, the styling
      changes again are defined within the style block towards the top:

      <img
        src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53568458324_4c8d2a53ab_w.jpg"
        alt="example of id"
      />

      Styling changes can also be defined within the CSS page, the syntax for
      class is using a fullstop and a hashtag for id. Below is an example of
      styling changes for a class named 'intro' in CSS:

      <img
        src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53568338308_02ddf75686_n.jpg"
        alt="example of class styling in css"
      />

      And an example of an id in CSS:

      <img
        src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53567294307_8103a0908d_m.jpg"
        alt="example of id in css"
      />
