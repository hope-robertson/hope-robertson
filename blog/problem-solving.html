      <p>An example of when i got blocked on a simple problem is when I didn't know how involved the
        code needed to be for the JavaScript Kata. <br> <br> To solve this, I provided the Google Gemini LLC examples of
        the test environment and asked me to explain what i was looking at <br> <br>
        I felt unsure and slightly guilty about using AI for
        help because I haven't used it much before and as an arty type I am quite suspicious of it. <br><br> Through going down this avenue I learned how
        testing environments work and that only small lines of code were
        expected of me. <br><br> An example of when I elegantly solved a problemos when I 
        was struggling to relate javascript methods to real-world examples,
        especially regarding methods to do with mathematics. <br>
        I had become quite disillusioned and overwhelmed at the idea of having to use maths, so I took a break and came up with the idea of
        using some information from some of my collectible cards to provide data
        for method examples and to remind myself of the ways in which i have been using maths over the last few years. As my confidence grew, I became more relaxed and could write code more easily.
        <br>I started to come up with more complex ideas on how to expand on what I was doing and made a note in the pseudocode in case i get the chance to revisit it.
        <br><br>
        <h2>Here are some reflections on how I am feeling using each of these problem-solving methods:</h2>
        Pseudocode - I am starting to get
        more confident with this, even though it is tempting to just dive into
        doing everything <br><br>
        Trying something - i am confident in doing this with
        online test environments but still have fears about breaking everything
        when i try to change small things. <br><br>
        Rubber ducky method - I am naturally
        someone who talks their way through tasks, regardless of whether i am
        around people or not so this one is a good strategy for me. My cats are
        the current rubber duckies. <br><br>
        Reading error messages - i'm still in the
        early stages of knowing what the error messages mean but i have been
        asking the gemini LLM for clarification on what they mean within the
        contexts that i am working in<br><br>
        Console.logging - i feel like this still
        hasn't clicked for me and should probably find an online exercise/video
        to follow along with to improve before bootcamp starts<br><br> 
        Googling - I was
        born to google <br><br>
        Asking your peers for help - I have not tried this much
        yet but have had some good discussions with peers after finishing the
        listening and looping exercises, which has helped me feel like i'm on
        the right path <br><br>
        Asking coaches for help - I had been doing this a lot up
        until recently but writing code has been less confusing lately and I
        have been enjoying developing my own problem solving skills, especially
        before things get more complicated in bootcamp. <br><br>
        Improving your process
        with reflection - This has been immensely helpful and admitting to
        myself that there are only a certain amount of hours in the day during
        which i can sit quietly with my thoughts has helped me to form a
        routine. I have found watching videos on using tone.js to make sound
        loops and oscillate tone frequencies has helped me reflect on how using
        these concepts leads to physical results similar to what i already know
        how to do with hardware. <br><br>
        I was reluctant to ask for help when my code
        wouldn't push to github, as i just wanted to keep going with the
        challenges and i had a suspicion that i had made a very simple error
        when cloning the repo from github. <br>Next time i will ask for help in the
        after hours channel and take a break, as it would have been easy for
        someone knowledgeable and more well rested than me at the time to see
        where i had gone wrong. <br>My approach led me to have to commit all of my
        answers at the same time which was time consuming and generally a bad
        practice.
