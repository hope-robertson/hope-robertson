      Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you: 1. were blocked on a
      simple problem: what was the problem? - i didn't know how involved the
      code needed to be for the JavaScript Kata what problem-solving techniques
      did you use? - i provided the Google Gemini LLC examples of the test
      environment and asked me to explain what i was looking at how did you feel
      throughout the process? - i felt unsure about using AI for help because I
      haven't used it much before what did you learn? - how testing environments
      work and that only small lines of code were expected of me 2. elegantly
      solved a problem. what was the problem? i was struggling to relate
      javascript methods to real-world examples, especially regarding methods to
      do with mathematics what problem-solving techniques did you use? I took a
      break and came up with the idea of using some information from some of my
      collectible cards to provide data for method examples. how did you feel
      throughout the process? I felt more confident in my mathematical abilities
      as I already know I have managed to comprehend the maths involved in
      playing this particular card game. what did you learn? to keep it simple
      but write some pseudocode at the end containing my thoughts on how to
      improve or expand on the initial idea 3. Reflect on how confident you feel
      using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes: Pseudocode - I
      am starting to get more confident with this, even though it is tempting to
      just dive into doing everything Trying something - i am confident in doing
      this with online test environments but still have fears about breaking
      everything when i try to change small things. Rubber ducky method - I am
      naturally someone who talks their way through tasks, regardless of whether
      i am around people or not so this one is a good strategy for me. My cats
      are the current rubber duckies. Reading error messages - i'm still in the
      early stages of knowing what the error messages mean but i have been
      asking the gemini LLM for clarification on what they mean within the
      contexts that i am working in Console.logging - i feel like this still
      hasn't clicked for me and should probably find an online exercise/video to
      follow along with to improve before bootcamp starts Googling - I was born
      to google Asking your peers for help - I have not tried this much yet but
      have had some good discussions with peers after finishing the listening
      and looping exercises, which has helped me feel like i'm on the right path
      Asking coaches for help - I had been doing this a lot up until recently
      but writing code has been less confusing lately and I have been enjoying
      developing my own problem solving skills, especially before things get
      more complicated in bootcamp. Improving your process with reflection -
      This has been immensely helpful and admitting to myself that there are
      only a certain amount of hours in the day during which i can sit quietly
      with my thoughts has helped me to form a routine. I have found watching
      videos on using tone.js to make sound loops and oscillate tone frequencies
      has helped me reflect on how using these concepts leads to physical
      results similar to what i already know how to do with hardware. 4. Reflect
      on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you
      reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time? I was
      reluctant to ask for help when my code wouldn't push to github, as i just
      wanted to keep going with the challenges and i had a suspicion that i had
      made a very simple error when cloning the repo from github. Next time i
      will ask for help in the after hours channel and take a break, as it would
      have been easy for someone knowledgeable and more well rested than me at
      the time to see where i had gone wrong. My approach led me to have to
      commit all of my answers at the same time which was time consuming and
      generally a bad practice.
