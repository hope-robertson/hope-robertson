        One thing to understand about neuroplasticity in this context is that it
        works through a process called synaptic pruning - as we gain new
        experiences, come synaptic connections become stringer while others are
        eliminated. Neurons that are used often develop stronger connections.
        Those that are rarely or never used eventually die. This pruning process
        allows our brains to adapt to changing environments. Letting this happen
        helps promote the ability to learn new things, enhance existing
        cognitive capabilities, recover from strokes or traumatic brain injury
        and strengthening areas where function is lost or has declined. <br />
        <br />
        Simply having the knowledge that scientifically, our brains can change
        and adapt gives us confidence and motivation to dive into learning new
        things. We can also adopt learning strategies specific to how our brains
        work in order to develop skills and retain information. In addition to
        learning strategies. the principles of neuroplasticity promote lifestyle
        changes for improved brain health, which can lead to a better state of
        mental well-being.<br />
        <br />
        One way I have been engaging with the principles of neuroplasticity so
        far is when i have been using data from real world things I already know
        about, such as the rules of a complex card game so that an existing
        pathway is being strengthened with new information on how to write code.
        <br />
        <br />

        The main things I will integrate into my learning plan to benefit from
        the principles of neuroplasticity are getting enough sleep, spending
        some time socialising, regular exercise to increase blood flow to the
        brain and maintaining a healthy diet. <br />
        <br />
        I was surprised to find out quite how simple a growth mindset is - it is
        maybe a concept that has been integrated into communities who lift each
        other up and push each other to do better, learn from their mistakes
        etc. I consider myself lucky to have had such nurturing friends and hope
        to take what I've learned from them about being kind to myself while
        also striving to improve always and put it into practice as a programmer
        as well as a musician and artist. One thing I will focus on is viewing
        my mistakes as opportunities to learn. <br />
